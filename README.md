<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

###  Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the app uses:

- This project utilizes [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) for app development. React Native is a powerful JavaScript library that enables the creation of cross-platform mobile applications using a single codebase for both iOS and Android. Expo enhances the development experience by offering a suite of tools and services to streamline building, testing, and deploying apps efficiently.

- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a NoSQL database, which allows us to store and manage flexible and scalable data structures.

- To handle backend routes and API calls, the app primarily uses [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is used to containerize the server, ensuring consistent environments for development and deployment, simplifying scaling, and improving overall application reliability.

- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is utilized for specific functionalities, including OCR and detecting the userâ€™s skin type using a trained model.

- [EasyOcr](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) an open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) library is utilized to extract text from images or scanned documents.

- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), a popular computer vision library, is used for face detection. It utilizes the pre-trained classifier model to detect face counting in images.

- The app uses [ React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/) for the design and front-end components, providing a modern, and accessible user interface based on Material Design principles.

- The app integrates [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for AI-powered features enhancing user interaction.

- [String-Similarity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-similarity-js) is used to improve product search functionality by matching similar text strings, offering better comparison results.

- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is used for training machine learning model to integrate skin type classification.

- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) is utilized for authentication and session management.

###
<!-- ###  Mastering Interaction: Unveiling the Power of Prompt Engineering: -->

This project uses OpenAI to optimize tasks like ingredient compatibility checks and personalized recommendations, highlighting the transformative power of AI-driven solutions.<br>
 The goal is to use AI-driven solutions to enhance user experiences.

To check ingredients, the app first processes the uploaded image by EasyOCR. The OCR extracts ingredient names, or product information converting it into text. Once the ingredients are extracted, the data is sent to OpenAI. OpenAI analyzes the data and checks the compatibility of ingredients.

To get personalized recommendations, the app processes the images using a pre-trained model (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) using OpenCV to detect number of faces within the image. If the count of faces detected is different than 1 the app will ask the user to retry. If one face detected the image wil be processed by skin type prediction model.Then this data is sent to OpenAI that generates personalized recommendations.
