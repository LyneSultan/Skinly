<!-- Tech stack -->

###  Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [MERN stack](https://mern.io/), which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. MERN allows us to build a full-stack web application with a single language (JavaScript) for both the client and server.

- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a NoSQL database, which allows us to store and manage flexible and scalable data structures.

- To handle backend routes and API calls, the app uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/), a web application framework for Node.js, which simplifies routing and middleware integration.

- The app uses [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) for the design and front-end components, providing a modern, responsive, and accessible user interface based on Material Design principles.

- The app uses the font ["Poppins"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) as its main font, offering a clean and modern design aesthetic that aligns with the material design guidelines.
<!--
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.

- ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve! -->
