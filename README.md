<!-- Tech stack -->

###  Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the app uses:

- This project utilizes [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) with [Expo](https://expo.dev/) for app development. React Native is a powerful JavaScript library that enables the creation of cross-platform mobile applications using a single codebase for both iOS and Android. Expo enhances the development experience by offering a suite of tools and services to streamline building, testing, and deploying apps efficiently.

- For persistent storage (database), the app uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), a NoSQL database, which allows us to store and manage flexible and scalable data structures.

- To handle backend routes and API calls, the app primarily uses [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.

  - [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is utilized for specific functionalities, including OCR and detecting the userâ€™s skin type using a trained model.

- The app uses [ React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/) for the design and front-end components, providing a modern, responsive, and accessible user interface based on Material Design principles.
<!--
- The app uses the font ["Poppins"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) as its main font, offering a clean and modern design aesthetic that aligns with the material design guidelines.
